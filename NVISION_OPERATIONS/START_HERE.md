## The Only 3 Rules

### Rule 1: Start Where You Are
You're in Phase 0. Don't skip to Phase 2. Prove demand first.

### Rule 2: Track Everything
Use the scorecards and tracking tools. You can't improve what you don't measure.

### Rule 3: Execute Daily
This only works if you work it. 2 hours/day minimum on outreach, shooting, or delivery.
