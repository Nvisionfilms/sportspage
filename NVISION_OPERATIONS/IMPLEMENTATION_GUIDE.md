2. **Underpricing to get clients** - Charge what you're worth
3. **Not tracking numbers** - You can't improve what you don't measure
4. **Trying to do everything** - Focus on sports content, not weddings/events
5. **Giving up too early** - 90 days minimum to see real results

---

## When You Get Stuck

**Ask yourself:**
1. Am I in the right phase?
2. Have I completed the prerequisites for this phase?
3. What's the smallest next step I can take?
4. Who can I ask for help or advice?

**Then:**
- Review the relevant phase folder
- Use decision frameworks in `MASTER_PLAYBOOK/decision-frameworks.md`
- Take action (even if imperfect)
