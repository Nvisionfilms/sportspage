## Critical Path Items (Can't Skip)

1. **Funding secured** – No money, no facility
2. **Lease signed** – No space, no build-out
3. **Permits approved** – Can't legally operate without them
4. **Insurance in place** – Too risky to operate without it
5. **Proof of demand from Phase 1** – Don't build if no one wants it

---

## Red Flags to Watch For

- **Landlord won't allow build-out** – Walk away
- **Zoning doesn't permit sports/media use** – Walk away
- **Ceiling height too low** – Won't work for basketball
- **Lease too short (less than 3 years)** – Not worth the investment
- **Build-out costs exceed budget by 20%+** – Reassess or find cheaper space
- **No demand signals from Phase 1** – Don't move forward

---

- [ ] Funding secured ($250K)
