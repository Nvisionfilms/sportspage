- [ ] It's outside your brand (e.g., weddings when you do sports)
- [ ] Margins are thin or unclear

## General Decision-Making Principles

### 1. Trust Your Gut
If something feels off, it probably is. Don't ignore red flags.

### 2. Sleep On It
Big decisions deserve 24-48 hours. Don't rush.

### 3. Ask "What's the Worst That Could Happen?"
If you can live with the worst case, take the risk.

### 4. Bias Toward Action
Indecision is a decision. When in doubt, test small and learn fast.

### 5. Protect Your Energy
Say no to things that drain you, even if they're profitable.

### 6. Focus on the Long Game
Short-term wins that hurt long-term vision aren't worth it.

### 7. Get Advice, But Decide Yourself
Listen to others, but you live with the consequences. You decide.

## When You're Stuck

**Ask yourself:**
1. What would I do if I weren't afraid?
2. What would I advise my best friend to do?
3. Will this matter in 5 years?
4. What's the smallest step I can take to move forward?

**Then do that.**
