# Phone Script: Coach / Athletic Director

## Opening (First 20 Seconds)

"Hi Coach [Last Name], this is [Your Name] with NVision Films. Do you have a quick minute?"

**[If Yes]**
"Great! I work with schools and clubs across Central Texas creating professional sports media content. I wanted to reach out because [specific reason: saw your team play, worked with another program in your district, etc.] and thought there might be a good fit to support your program."

**[If No]**
"No problem! When would be a better time—or would email be easier?"

**Ask:**
- "How do you currently handle media for your program? [Photos, videos, social media]"
- "Do families ask about highlight films or recruiting content?"

**Listen for:**
- Pain points (no time, no budget, parents asking for content)

- Decision-making process (who decides, what's the timeline)

**Key Insight:**
Coaches care about:
1. **Zero hassle** (they're already overwhelmed)
2. **No cost to their budget** (or minimal cost)
3. **Helping their athletes** (recruiting, confidence, culture)

## Handle Objections

### "We don't have budget for this"
"Totally understand. Most programs don't. That's why we typically work directly with families—they pay for their athlete's content, and you get the benefit of having professional media for your program. It costs you nothing."

### "We already have a parent who films"
"That's great! A lot of programs do. The difference is we're creating recruiting-quality content and social media packages that families can actually use. We're also taking the burden off that parent volunteer. But I'd love to show you some samples so you can see the difference."

### "Let me talk to [AD/Principal/Booster Club]"
"Absolutely. What would be helpful for that conversation? I can send you:
- Samples of our work
- Pricing options
- Testimonials from other coaches
- A one-pager you can share"

### "We're in the middle of the season"
"I get it—timing's tough. Would it make sense to connect after the season to plan for next year? Or we could start small with just [one game / playoff coverage] to test it out."
