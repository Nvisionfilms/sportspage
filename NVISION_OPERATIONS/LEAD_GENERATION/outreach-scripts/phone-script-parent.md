# Phone Script: Parent/Family

## Opening (First 15 Seconds)

"Hi [Parent Name], this is [Your Name] with NVision Films. Is now a good time for a quick call?"

**[If Yes]**
"Great! I wanted to reach out because [specific reason: saw your son/daughter play, was referred by X, etc.]. We create professional sports media content for youth athletes—basically, we turn game footage into recruiting-quality highlights and social content that kids actually want to post."

**[If No]**
"No problem! When would be a better time to call back?"

## Discovery (2-3 Minutes)

**Ask:**
- "What sport(s) does [Athlete Name] play?"
- "What level? [School team, club, both]"
- "Have you worked with anyone for sports media before?"
- "What's most important to you—recruiting content, social media, or just capturing memories?"

**Listen for:**
- Pain points (no good photos/videos, don't know how to make highlights)
- Goals (recruiting, social media, family memories)
- Budget signals (what they've paid before, what they value)

## Handle Objections

### "That's expensive"
"I totally get it. Let me ask—what were you expecting to invest in this?"
[Listen, then adjust or explain value]

"Most families tell us they wish they'd started earlier because the content becomes so valuable for recruiting and memories."

### "Let me think about it"
"Absolutely. What questions can I answer to help you decide?"
[Answer questions, then:]
"Would it help if I sent you some samples and pricing in writing?"

### "We'll just use our phone"
"That totally works for some families! The difference is we're capturing it from a coaching/recruiting angle, editing it professionally, and delivering it in formats that actually work for social and recruiting. But I get it—let me send you some samples so you can see the difference."
