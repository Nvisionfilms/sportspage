## Red Flags (Disqualify or Deprioritize)

- **Price shopping only** – "What's your cheapest option?" with no interest in value
- **Unrealistic expectations** – Wants NFL-level production for $50
- **Difficult personality** – Rude, demanding, disrespectful in first interaction
- **No decision-making power** – Can't commit without 5 other people
- **Chronic "maybe"** – Always interested but never commits

---

## Green Flags (Fast-Track)

- **Referred by happy client** – Pre-sold on you
- **Already familiar with your work** – Follows you on social, seen your content
- **Asks about availability** – "Are you available for..."
- **Talks about long-term** – "We'd want this every season"
- **Easy to work with** – Responsive, clear, respectful

## Monthly Lead Review

**First week of each month, review:**
- A-Tier leads that didn't convert – Why? Move to B-Tier or disqualify?
- B-Tier leads that went cold – Move to C-Tier nurture?
- C-Tier leads that showed new interest – Move to B-Tier?
- D-Tier leads – Archive or delete?

**Goal:** Keep your pipeline clean and focused on leads that will actually convert.
