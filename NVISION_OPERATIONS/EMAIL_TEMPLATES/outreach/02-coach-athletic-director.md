Coach [Last Name] / [Title],

I'm [Your Name] with NVision Films. We work with schools and clubs across Central Texas to create professional sports media content that:

✓ Builds program culture and pride  
✓ Helps with recruiting (for you and your athletes)  
✓ Engages parents and the community  
✓ Costs you nothing (we work directly with families or through team packages)

**What we've done:**
- [X teams] across [Y schools/clubs]
- [Specific example: "Season highlight films for Hays HS Basketball"]
- [Specific example: "Media days for Elite Hoops AAU"]

**What we offer:**
- **Team Media Days** – Intro videos, player spotlights, team photos
- **Game Coverage** – Highlight reels, social content
- **Seasonal Packages** – Full-season documentation
- **Recruiting Support** – College-ready highlight films

I'd love to show you some samples and discuss how we can support your program—at no cost to your budget.

Are you available for a quick call next week?

Best,
