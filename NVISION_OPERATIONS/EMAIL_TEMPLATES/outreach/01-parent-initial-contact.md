**Subject:** Capture [Athlete Name]'s Season the Right Way

---

Hi [Parent Name],

I'm [Your Name] with NVision Films—we create hype content for youth athletes across Central Texas.

I saw [Athlete Name] play [recently/at X event] and wanted to reach out. We specialize in turning game footage into recruiting-quality highlights and social media content that actually gets posted and shared.

**What we do:**
- Game highlight reels
- Pre-season media days (photos + video)
- Recruiting cuts for older athletes
- Social-ready content (reels, posts, stories)

**Why parents work with us:**
- Kids actually love the content and post it
- Clean, professional quality
- Fast turnaround (48-72 hours)
- You own everything—no watermarks

I'd love to send you some samples and pricing. Would [Day] or [Day] work for a quick 10-minute call?

Best,
[Your Name]

## When to Use
- Initial cold outreach to parents
- After filming an event where you met them briefly
- When referred by another parent

## Customization Notes
- Always mention something specific (saw them play, referred by X, etc.)
- Keep it short—parents are busy
- Lead with benefit, not features
- Make next step easy (call or send samples)

## Follow-Up Sequence
- Day 3: Follow-up if no response
- Day 7: Send sample reel + pricing
- Day 14: Final check-in
