[Director Name],

I'm [Your Name] with NVision Films—we create professional media content for youth sports programs across Texas.

I've been following [Club Name] and wanted to reach out about partnering on media days and tournament coverage.

**What we do for clubs:**
- **Pre-Season Media Days** – Team intros, player spotlights, roster reveals
- **Tournament Coverage** – Highlight reels, championship content
- **Recruiting Content** – Individual player films for college coaches
- **Social Media Packages** – Reels, posts, stories that drive engagement

**Why clubs work with us:**
- Parents love it (and will pay for it)
- Elevates your program's brand
- Helps with recruiting (players and sponsors)
- Zero hassle for you—we handle everything

**Revenue Model Options:**
1. **Team Package** – Club pays, we cover everyone ($750-$1,500)
2. **Family Opt-In** – Families pay individually, you get credit
3. **Hybrid** – Club covers basics, families upgrade for premium

I'd love to send you samples and discuss what makes sense for [Club Name].

Available for a call this week?
