Hi [Name],

We talked [timeframe] ago about working together on [specific thing], but the timing wasn't right.

Just wanted to reach out and let you know we're still here and still working with families/teams across [City/Region].

**What's new:**
- [New service or offering]
- [New package or pricing]
- [Recent work sample or case study]

If you're interested in working together this season, I'd love to reconnect.

If not, no worries—feel free to reach out whenever the timing's better!

Best,
[Your Name]
