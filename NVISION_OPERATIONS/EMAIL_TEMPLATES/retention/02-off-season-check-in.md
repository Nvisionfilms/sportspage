Hi [Parent Name],

Hope you're having a great off-season!

I wanted to check in and see what [Athlete Name] is up to:
- Playing another sport?
- Training for next season?
- Doing camps or showcases?

**Off-Season Content Options:**
- **Training Montages** – Capture the grind (gym, field work, etc.)
- **Camp/Showcase Coverage** – Recruiting content from summer events
- **Multi-Sport Package** – If [he/she/they] plays multiple sports

I'm also working on some new offerings:
- [New service 1]
- [New service 2]

Let me know if you want to keep the momentum going!

Best,
[Your Name]
