# Email Template: After Sample Sent

**Subject:** Thoughts on the samples?

---

[Name],

Just checking in—did you get a chance to check out the samples I sent over?

I'd love to hear your thoughts and answer any questions about:
- Pricing
- Timeline
- What a partnership would look like

If you're interested, we can start as soon as [next week / this season / before playoffs].

Let me know!

Best,
[Your Name]

## When to Use
- 3-4 days after sending samples
- When they opened the email but didn't respond

## Customization Notes
- Assume they're interested but busy
- Offer specific next steps
- Create urgency (season timing)
