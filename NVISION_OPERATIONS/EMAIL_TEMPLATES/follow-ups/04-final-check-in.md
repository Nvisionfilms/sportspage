# Email Template: Final Check-In

**Subject:** Last check-in – [Athlete/Team Name]

[Name],

I wanted to reach out one last time about working together on [specific service].

I know timing isn't always right, and that's totally fine—but I didn't want to let this fall through the cracks if you were still interested.

**If you'd like to move forward:**
Just reply and we can get started.

**If now's not the right time:**
No worries at all—feel free to reach out whenever the timing works better.

Either way, best of luck with the season!

Best,
[Your Name]
[Phone]
