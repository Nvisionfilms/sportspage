# "Rookie to Recruit" Multi-Year Pilot Package

## Package Overview
The ultimate long-term athlete documentation program—capture their entire journey from youth sports to college recruiting. Build a relationship, tell their story, and create recruiting content that actually works.

## The Concept

Most families wish they had professional documentation of their athlete's journey. By the time recruiting starts, they're scrambling to piece together phone footage from 5 years ago.

**"Rookie to Recruit" solves this.**

We document their journey from the beginning:
- Youth sports (8-12 years old)
- Middle school (13-14)
- High school (15-18)
- Recruiting (junior/senior year)

By the time they're ready for college, you have:
- Years of professional footage
- A complete story to tell
- Recruiting content that stands out
- Memories that last forever

## Why This Works (The LTV Model)

### Traditional Approach
- Family pays $500-1,000 per season
- 8 seasons = $4,000-$8,000
- Scrambles for recruiting content senior year
- Pays $1,000-$2,000 for recruiting film from scratch

**Total: $5,000-$10,000+ (fragmented, reactive)**

### "Rookie to Recruit" Approach
- One relationship, one provider
- Continuous documentation
- Recruiting content built over time
- Complete story told

**Total: $14,000-$16,500 (comprehensive, proactive)**

### The Value Difference
- **Recruiting advantage:** Coaches see the full journey, not just senior year
- **Storytelling:** Authentic, long-term narrative
- **Memories:** Professional documentation of entire career
- **Convenience:** One provider, one relationship
- **Cost:** Comparable or less than piecemeal approach

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What if my athlete quits the sport?**  
You can pause or cancel. If they switch sports, we can pivot with them.

**What if we move?**  
If you move outside our coverage area, we can discuss options (remote coverage, referral to another provider, etc.).

**Can we add siblings?**  
Yes! Sibling discount available (20% off second athlete).

**What if we can't afford the full program?**  
We offer payment plans and can discuss shorter commitments (3-5 years instead of 8).

**What if my athlete doesn't end up playing in college?**  
That's okay! The content is still valuable for memories, and many families say it's worth it regardless of recruiting outcomes.

**How is this different from just hiring you each season?**  
Locked-in pricing, priority scheduling, long-term storytelling, and recruiting strategy. Plus, you're not scrambling each year to rebook.

## Why We're Doing This

We believe the best recruiting content isn't created in one season—it's built over years. We want to work with families who value long-term relationships, authentic storytelling, and preparing their athletes for the next level.

This pilot program is our way of testing the model, refining the process, and creating case studies that prove the value of long-term athlete documentation.

**Let's build something special together.**
